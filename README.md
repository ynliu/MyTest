_*comes packaged with node._
* Install its command line interface (CLI) globally

        npm install -g grunt-cli

* Install dependencies with npm

        npm install


_*Topcoat uses Grunt 0.4.0 you might want to [read](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) more on their website if you haven't upgraded since a lot has changed.._

* Type `grunt` in the command line to build the css.
* The results will be built into the release folder.
* Alternatively type `grunt watch` to have the build run automatically when you make changes to
source files.
